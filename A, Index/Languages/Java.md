Java is one of some popular [[High Level programming languages]].
**Java** is an **object oriented, Class-based** programming language that is used as a general purpose programming language and influenced many other similar languages such as:    
**[[JavaScript]], [[CSharp]], and [[Python]]**.

**Java** Runs on many different platforms but we write it the same way on all of them, the syntax for it is relatively simple to understand as it uses basic algebra and other things such as: **Public, Static, Void, Main**, etc.

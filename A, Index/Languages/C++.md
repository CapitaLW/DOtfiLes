C++ is a low level coding language that's very,  fundamentally, similar to the other C languages, C, and [[CSharp]],  but also VERY different from C and [[CSharp]]
The C family harbors  C, [[CSharp]] and [[C++]].
is very similar to [[CSharp]] in relation to game development as [[Unreal Engine]] Uses [[C++]] while [[Unity Game Engine]] uses [[CSharp]].

### World War?
Unsurprisingly, there was a time that the world didn't agree with each other in millions of different ways. (still don't)
- So much so, that the *motherfuckers* decided to go to **war**.

Some reasons for WW1 and [[WWII]] (2 being easier), were mostly diplomatic, economical, political or France being big ass babies.

Example texts:	
#### [[Causes For WW1 and perchance WW2]]
#### [[Technology in World War 1]]
#### [[WWI colonies!!!]]
#### [[Treaty Of Versailles]]
### Communism
Less of a curve ball, [[Communism]] had much more to do with [[WWI]], I think
Also, [[Russia - Soviet Union]] had LOTS of communism in it!
### Fash Ism
Now, **Fascism** was really common after [[WWI]], (very, **Very** important for [[WWII]])

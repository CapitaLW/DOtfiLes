## Overview
Around the 1980's, African Americans facing racial injustice demanded an end to the unjust system known as **Apartheid** which stands for **Apartness** in Afrikaans (I think).
	It was a policy of legal discrimination directed towards the majority of African American people. This oppression was nothing new for Africa, especially considering the Berlin Conference's events.
European Colonial governments applied restrictions upon the population, ranging from marriage to employment or housing. They enforced this with weaponry to control the majority population of African Americans.

## Anti-Apartheid Movement
The Anti-Apartheid movement was a activist heavy movement involving many different Political Parties in which they used nonviolent activism to advocate for change.

## Communism 
It was mostly sorta kinda a Russia thing, but other communist countries (china for example) copied the things that Russia did (very dumb play)

### whats Communism
Its a political and economic ideology that mainly goods, services, etc are owned by the people. There is NO private property at all.
they argue that Private property is a form of theft, However, Personal property can still exist. Private property is moreso a thing related to businesses.

Resources are distributed via need, however, typically, communist implementation has lack of innovation, lack of incentive, corruption, etc - typically causing dastardly results

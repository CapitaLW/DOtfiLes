## Overview
The treaty of Versailles was a treaty that officially ended WWI. It was signed on June 28 1919.
	32 Countries came together in Paris to hold a conference which would make peace during WWI

The conference was dominated by the big 3 countries in the war:
#### David Lloyd George - B
Who of which operated as Britain

#### Georges Clemenceau - F  
Whom operated as Fr* nce

#### Woodrow Wilson - U
Who operated as the USA

### Germany wasn't invited
The Big 3 wanted different things to happen to [[Germany]] and they all disagreed how harshly they were 
to be punished,  when reflecting on how they were treated in war,  but they had to negotiate until there was a compromise.
The U.S didn't have much damage so they didn't feel like they should retaliate much
France took the brunt of the damage so they wanted [[Germany]] to repay LOT
	like disbanding their military,  paying hefty fines
Britain did take losses in some aspects but mostly stayed the same. So they took a bit more of a diplomatic course of action.

This becomes another catalyst for Germany to boo hoo about. (also the mustache man cites this also as a big boo boo - or another thing to be mad at)


TLDR.  this thingamabob becomes [[Germany]]'s 13th reason why they should go to war, Almost won.

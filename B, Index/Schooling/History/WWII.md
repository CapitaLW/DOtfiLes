# Overview
World War II was less of a second world war but more of a continuation of WWI. The Armistice or ceasefire was caused by the [[Treaty Of Versailles]] which caused peace for the time being.

The main causes for WWII were in relation to [[Germany]] and their treatment after WWI. Germany saw the treaty as a slap in the face and eventually, when Adolf Hitler came to power, WWII was already underway.
#### But wait! What about before?
Before WWII, [[WWI]] had to occur. 
	See [[WWI]] for important context
A brief Overview:
	Franz Ferdinand was the archduke for Austria-Hungary. He was assassinated by Serbian terrorists. This kicked off the War because France was mad at Hungary and since Germany was allied with Hungary, Germany caught a stray. Since Germany fought hard and the major 3 (Britain France and USA) felt Germany needed to pay heavy restitution for its damage, they made a treaty which would stop WWI (temporarily) and get Germany to pay its dues. (This was another reason for WWII)
## Important Contexts and Other Info
#### The Holocaust
The holocaust was a mass Genocide of Many different people,  The main target being Jewish people. It was the systemic extermination of 2/3 Of Europe's Jewish population by Nazi Germany and its collaborators. 
It led to the death to 6 million Jews and another 6 million others like those with disabilities, lgbtq+, etc.

Antisemitism existed in Europe for centuries but got especially extreme in the 19th century with the rise of nationalism.
After Hitler's failed coup, his National Socialist party won a democratic election in 1933 and he then became Chancellor.

The Nazis used law to facilitate the persecution of Jews and others that didn't fit their vision. Jews were mainly forced to live in Ghettos. (or segregated areas/neighborhoods)

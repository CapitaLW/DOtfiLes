## Overview
After japan won WWI (cough)
And also after their modernization 

Surprisingly, Japan was also a country that participated in [[The ism that Fasc-es]]

## Manchukuo
**The puppet emperor of Manchukuo** 
The leader of Manchukuo was sometimes referred to as this when he was under Japanese rule

(formerly Manchuria)
Manchukuo was a nation about north-east of china.
The leader was Chinese, but he has still the leader of the place. 
He was called a puppet emperor because he was controlled by the Japanese government. His name? **Puyi, the last emperor of China**

He was overthrown at 6

## Back to Fascism
Japan had a pretty strong history relating to Fascism and even more so WWII, 
They defeated Russia and China at a turn of the century, while inadvertently creating an emerging threat, **The Soviet Union (USSR)**
Fascist Imperialism became quite problematic, like:
	Limited resources
	Nationalism / feeling of ethnic superiority

The Invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and the establishment of Manchukuo in 1932
(the second Sino-Japanese war also occurs in 1937-1945)

## Authoritarianism In japan
They (Japan) were very big on civilian and military authority, they modeled their approach similar to [[Germany]] (uh oh) around the 1800's
Japan did not put elected officials in charge of the military. Instead, they gave the emperor total control.

	**submarines, cars, machine guns and many other things were also made**
	
**Chemical warfare** was also a big part of the world wars,  Mustard gas was a main weapon used to kill the opposing side, Among other things.

During World War 1, Developments in military technology led to more deaths due to them.

## Trench Warfare
A bigger part of the wars was trench warfare, When they realized that guns were much more accurate they gave up on fighting in the open like the previous Wars.

They'd dig a series of holes in order to protect themselves from enemy fire, 

## Total War
In general its defined as military conflict between nations who in which are willing to make any and or all sacrifices in order to win. Even if it meant people must perish in order to do so.

#### Overview
Rwanda was one of [[Germany]]'s **colonies** that was **taken over by Belgium after the Germans lost their colonies** in [[WWI]].
The Belgian Colonial government issued **identity cards** to all Rwandans with their **official 'ethnic identity'** _-it wasn't really based on race, moreso social status_
	Hutu: The Majority of the Population
	Tutsi: a **minority** of the population but was considered **elite and had the most power**.
Instead of **resenting the Belgians**, They (the Hutu) resented the **Tutsi**, causing many issues surrounding the population.
Post [[WWII]] calls for **independence mostly led by the Hutu**, which led to **violence towards the Tutsi** (up to 100,000 killed - 150,000 left most likely safety)
	 Rwanda becomes independent in 1942, like most African colonies.

| The Hutus and Tutsi did live together before colonization. Since the Belgians colonized them, they were seperated into 2 different groups, The Tutsi had much more power | They divided the population into two groups, the Hutus (majority of the population) and the Tutsi (the Elite and powerful). The government brainwashed their people to believing that the Tutsi were 'cockroaches', which led to the mass genocide | The Tutsi got more money and power Because they fit the beauty standards of the colonizers. Because of this, the Tutsi became rich and that caused resentment from the Hutu towards to the Tutsi |
